### Assignment1: Text Classification with RNNs  
- Task: Make Baseline, RNN, and LSTM models (with variants) from scratch using Pytorch  
  ```  
  * Self-Reflection *
  1. Should have used 'DataLoader' to load minibatch faster (Bottleneck happened due to the absence of DataLoader)
  2. Should have made meticulous first-draft for scalability before start coding  
  3. Necessity to be familiar with Hugging Face  
  ```
