Instead of using combinations or permutations in the 'collections' package, 
and then implementing 6 for-loops per node triples in the worst case, 
I just used single input, and included all the possible 'isomorphism' cases in 'if-elif' statement.
The entire code can be implemented in 40 seconds which is much less than the time criteria.
